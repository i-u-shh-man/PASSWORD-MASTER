# **PASSWORD MASTER:** 


 **D3F3NC3 & OFF3NC3 SUITE** 
 ---

**Description:** The PASSWORD MASTER suite (D3F3NC3/OFF3NC3) provides a critical, dual-purpose perspective on security. 

The project demonstrates **how attackers use acquired personal information (OSINT)** to create custom wordlists (OFF3NC3), fundamentally underscoring the absolute necessity of creating complex, high-entropy passwords, which the D3F3NC3 module teaches and measures.

## **🧭 Repository Structure**

| File | Project | Purpose |
| :---- | ----- | :---- |
| **PASSWORD MASTER D3F3NC3 \- SOURCE CODE** | Defense | **Interactive Password Strength Checker.** Contains the Python code for guiding users to create strong, compliant passwords. |
| **PASSWORD MASTER OFF3NC3 \- SOURCE CODE** | Offense | **Targeted Wordlist Generator.** Contains the Python code for generating highly customized password dictionaries for ethical testing. |
| **PM D3F3NC3 \- report.pdf** | Defense | Comprehensive technical report detailing the architecture, UI/UX implementation, and challenges of the defensive checker. |
| **PM OFF3NC3 \- report.pdf** | Offense | Comprehensive technical report detailing the algorithmic complexity, PII profiling strategy, and export integrity of the offensive tool. |
| **DEMO WORDLIST FOR OFF3NC3.txt** | Offense | Sample output file (.txt) generated by the OFF3NC3 module, formatted for use with external cracking tools. |

## **1\. PASSWORD MASTER D3F3NC3 (Defense Module)**


This module is designed as a **client-based tool** focused on **proactive defense**. Its primary function is to help users learn the current security standards and ensure their password measures security compliance before use.

### **Key Features:**

* Real-Time Feedback: Dynamic checklist SHOWS A TICK MARK WHEN THE REQUIREMENT OR CONDITION IS MET.  
* **Compliance:** Enforces minimum 10 characters, uppercase, digits, and symbols.  
* **High-Fidelity UI:** Dark theme, custom typography, and integrated visibility toggle for professional usability.

### **⚙️ Prerequisites:**

* **Python 3.x**  
* **VS Code** (used for coding and testing)  
* Standard **tkinter** and **re** modules (no external dependencies).



## **2\. PASSWORD MASTER OFF3NC3 (Offense Module)**


This module illustrates the methodology of **hackers and attackers** who acquire general information through social media and other mediums (OSINT). It focuses on **security auditing and testing**, via algorithmic dictionary generation to demonstrate **how easy it is to crack weak passwords**, and the resulting importance of making a strong one.

### **Key Features:**

* **Targeted Profiling:** Uses user-provided PII (Name, Pet, Year) as base words acquired via OSINT.  
* **Advanced Permutations:** Implements Leetspeak substitution (a \-\> 4, e \-\> 3, etc.) and intelligently appends common year suffixes (e.g., 2024, 24\) to create custom wordlists for brute-force attacks.  
* **Cracking Tool Ready:** Exports the unique, sorted wordlist in the standard .txt format required by tools like Hashcat.

### **⚙️ Prerequisites:**

* **Python 3.x**  
* **VS Code** (used for coding and testing)  
* Standard **tkinter** and **os** modules.
